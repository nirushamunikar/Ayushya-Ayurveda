                    <p><b>Therapeutic yoga for different diseases</b></p>
                    <p>Therapeutic yoga is the application of yoga postures, pranayama, meditation and yoga detox to
                        treat different diseases. It helps to prevent, reduce or alleviate structural, physiological,
                        emotional and spiritual pain or suffering. It also helps to recover from stress, anxiety,
                        depression, chronic pain, sleep disorder and enhances overall well-being and quality of life.
                        Yoga is recognized as a form of mind-body medicine that integrates an individual’s physical,
                        mental and spiritual components to improve the health.</p>
                    <p>The different categories of postures produce different energetic, mental, emotional and physical
                        effects. Yoga postures are not exercises. They are very subtle processes of manipulating energy
                        in a certain direction through which one can elevate his/her consciousness. In yoga postures
                        brain and body work together and energy is evenly balanced between the two. No other form of
                        exercise so completely involves the mind and spirit with the body, resulting in total
                        well-being. Yoga can help to fight fatigue and maintain your energy throughout the day. Yoga
                        postures are an effective treatment for a variety of diseases such as stress, headache, sleep
                        disorder, stiffness, fatigue, weakness etc.</p>
                    <p>We teach therapeutic yoga for the following and this can inspire ideas for other cases and
                        diseases: yoga for back pain, yoga for stress and anxiety, yoga for depression, yoga for high

                    <p> Pranayama is derived from two Sanskirt words – Prana (life force) and Ayama
                        (expansion). Therefore, Pranayama is the art and science of expanding your life force through
                        breathing techniques. The main goal of pranayama is to achieve mastery over mind by controlling
                        the

                    <p>The practice of breathing exercises guides you to use the breath for cleansing and purification.
                        The breath is a powerful tool to enhance inner cleansing and connectivity. The pranayama
                        (Breathing exercises) of Yoga helps in regulation of the breath and removes toxins from the
                        respiratory, digestive and nervous system. Pranayama boosts the immune system, repairs the cells
                        and makes up for the losses in energy levels of the body. Purification of the intestines, blood
                        and nerves does wonders for the overall health of the individual. The most obvious toxin
                        eliminated by the body during exhalation is carbon dioxide. Breathing practice in yoga draws in
                        more energy through oxygen during inhalations, while effectively eliminating more carbon dioxide
                        (CO2) during deep exhalations. Breathing techniques can help to open the lungs and loosen and
                        eliminate phlegm and mucus, cleansing the lungs and expel these by-products.</p>

                    <p>Bandhas mean to hold or lock the breath. The locks, specific contractions of core areas of the
                        body and control of prana (breath), bring steady flow of energy, harmony and balance to life.
                        With access to core values, you can express yourself with integrity. Without knowing the lock
                        system of prana (Breath), pranayama could not give good benefit, so bandha is fundamental for
                        the practice of pranayama. The locks are gateways to develop core strength, sensitivity and are
                        important to Kundalini awakening (awakening of inner energy). The practice of three bandhas
                        brings both depth and effectiveness to Yoga practice. Applying the body locks properly will help
                        you clear blockages that impede the free flow of energy through your physical body and Chakras
                        (energy center). In the practice of a Bandha, the pranic energy flows to a particular area of
                        the body. Then we lock by the practice of bandha to activate the energy of any specific
                        part.</p>

                    <p>Jalandar Banda (throat lock): Jalandar banda is the contraction of throat with the help of pranic
                        (breath) energy. The throat lock also “seals” the energy that is generated in the upper areas of
                        your brain stem, so it makes easier to focus and meditate. This is also good for thyroid and
                        parathyroid problem.</p>

                    <p>Uddiyan banda (abdominal lock): Contraction of abdominal muscles by holding the breath outside is
                        said to be uddiyan banda. Uddiyan banda helps to tones and strengthens the abdominal muscles and
                        improves the function of digestive organ.</p>
                    <p>Mulabanda (root lock): Contraction of peri-anal muscles and the navel point with breathing
                        process is mulabanda. Mulabanda helps to awake the energy on the upward direction. Mulabanda is
                        good to keep strength in body and steadiness in mind.</p>
                    <p>Tri-banda or Mahabanda (great lock): to apply all locks together is said to be tri-banda or great

                    <b>Fasting for yoga detox retreat</b>
                    <p>‘Eat, Fast and Live Longer’ is a highly recommended slogan. Fasting is the world’s most ancient
                        and natural healing practice. In fasting the body utilizes non-essential tissue like fat as
                        fuel. It also helps in rapid elimination of wastes or toxins from each and every cell of your
                        body, enhances the healing processes and stimulates the immune system. Fasting is thought to aid
                        the release of fat-soluble toxins from the body. </p>
                    <p>New research suggests starving the body kick-starts stem cells, forcing them to create new white
                        blood cells which fight infections. If you want to lose weight, increase energy levels, look and
                        feel healthier, fasting is the simplest and best process. Fasting is one of the most potent
                        tools available for assisting the body in healing itself. Fasting provides an opportunity for
                        the organisms to reboot both physically and mentally. </p>
                    <p>As a result of fasting, scientific research has proved that the brain power grows and you become
                        more intelligent. Only three days of water fasting reboots your immune system by activating the
                        stem cells and enables you to perform at the optimum level. All organs and glands get a
                        much-needed and well-deserved rest, during which their tissues are purified and rejuvenated and
                        their functions balanced and regulated. The entire alimentary canal is swept clean. By
                        rebuilding immunity, health is naturally restored and diseases disappear. There are many
                        physical, mental and spiritual benefits of fasting as:</p>

                    <p> Yogic relaxation and Mantra are the art of de-stress. The Science of Mantra is based on the
                        knowledge that sound is a form of energy that has the power to affect the chakras and the human
                        psyche. Method of yogic relaxation includes complete mental, physical and emotional relaxation
                        while maintaining awareness at deeper levels, called Yoga Nidra. Yoga nidra (Yogic sleep) is a
                        powerful technique of relaxation of mind and body. Yogic relaxation creates an altered state of
                        consciousness which allows the practitioner to relax and heal their being. Yogic relaxation will
                        help to enter the real subconscious & super conscious mind and cleans the negative impact of
                        past experiences. In this process we make calm our physical body then pranic body and then our
                        mental body which results in balancing every aspect of the body. Some visualization techniques

                    <p>It brings yourself back to your own nature. It is very effective in addressing a wide variety of
                        ailments and has power to relax every organ and every cell of the body which reduces stress from
                        the body and mind. In this relaxation, people can easily travel toward subconscious mind and can
                        take out suppressed negative thoughts and involuntary thoughts. Yoga Nidra works on many layers:
                        physical, spiritual, mental, energetic, emotional and cognitive. Deep relaxation (yoga nidra)
                        relaxes your body and mind and will help you to refresh and recharge. Yoga Nidra has more power
                        to relax than the sleep so doing an hour of yoga Nidra is believed to be as refreshing as having
                        four hours sleep. Main significance of yogic relaxation (Yoga Nidra) are as follows.</p>
                    <ul>

                            every cell, organ and glandular system.

                    <p>Mental ‘fitness’ is as equally important as physical fitness. In old age mental functions start
                        to decline with age which results in short term memory loss, forgetfulness and lack of
                        concentration. Mantra chanting and yogic relaxation makes an improvement in concentration and
                        confidence. Yoga Nidra is one of the most powerful yogic techniques for stress reduction and
                        personal transformation.</p>

                    <p>Meditation is a systematic approach to release stress and increase the awareness. It helps to
                        balance our energy centers (chakra) and to cope with your daily life stress and chronic stress.
                        It also helps to be aware of the present moment that in turn creates an unconditional peace and
                        awareness. The state of deep peace with pure awareness is called Meditation. Whatever done with
                        awareness is by definition meditation. In essence, meditation is more than just a technique; it
                        is a way of living. Meditation is a practice of living, a practice that increases
                        awareness. </p>
                    <p>Meditation is really effective to change your level of consciousness. Meditation is like a fire

                        true being. When you’re connected with your true self, it makes easy to know who you really are.
                        If you train yourself with the right meditation, peace becomes your real nature. There are
                        different techniques of meditation to develop your conscious level and provide you a new way of

                        your mind holds anger, fears, worries, stress, hatred, jealousy, ego, greed and so forth.

                        journey of detoxification.</p>
