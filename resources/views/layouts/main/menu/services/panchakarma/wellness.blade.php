    <h2>Wellness Panchakarma Program </h2>
    <p>Our health is a continuum process rather than a static phenomenon being affected by both the internal (Prakriti,
        Agni, Kostha, Oja, Sara and many others) and external (Diet, Behavior, Season, Environment and pollution, Work
        burden and stress and many more) factors. Our body-mind physiology is in constant interaction with these factors
        to grow, repair, rejuvenate and eliminate bio-toxins to maintain harmony and health. Our subtle bio-intelligence
        is maintaining these whole processes every time but in times is overshadowed and as a result we may loss the
        functional rhythm of life on micro-level. Whenever the aberration of functional rhythm is ignored, we get the
        disease. Panchakarma can be applied in all of these situations, from maintaining the bio-rhythm to correcting
        the bio-rhythmic aberration. Thus the Panchakarma can be used either to maintain and rejuvenate the health or to
        prevent and cure the disease. </p>
    <p>We have designed the Wellness Panchakarma Program in such a way to suit the need of our guest to maintain the
        health and to cure the disease. Besides the listed Program, we can tailor the Program as per the health status
        and Prakriti of our guest after consultation with our Ayurveda doctors. The uniquely powerful and dynamic
        Panchakarma program requires in residence stay at our Home to co-ordinate the program with the personalized
        Ayurvedic meals on the daily basis. The program begins with a consultation with an Ayurvedic doctor to assess
        the personal details and requirement of the guests. Each guest will be monitored on daily basis and adjustments
        to treatments will be provided if required.</p>
