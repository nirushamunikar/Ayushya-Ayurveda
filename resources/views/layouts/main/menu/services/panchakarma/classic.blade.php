    <h2>Classical Panchakarma Program </h2>
    <p>The unique Classical Panchakarma Program is designed as per the need and time availability of our guests
        following the Classical rules of Panchakarma. We have tailored the four Programs of Classical Panchakarma
        Program viz 30 days, 22 days, 15 days and 7 days to suit the demand of our guests. We suggest that the Full
        Classical Panchakarma Program of 30 days is more ideal as the time allows more treatments and provide the
        cumulative benefits. For those who cannot manage time for the Full Classical Panchakarma Program we have
        modified the program and reduced to fit into 22, 15 and 7 days program. The shorter treatment schedules are also
        equally beneficial in relation to the time availability of our guests. Whatever the length of your treatment
        schedule, the treatment schedules are complete and holistic and provide deep rest and rejuvenation to all the
        bodily systems. The shorter programs are ideal for seasonal adaption to climate and environmental stress and for
        those who are in transitional stages of life and desire general purification and rejuvenation. Although the
        shorter treatment schedules do not allow for all the 5 main ‘karmas’ or purification procedures of Panchakarma
        due to time constraints, still we can achieve a tremendous benefit.
        The uniquely powerful and dynamic Panchakarma program requires in residence stay at our Home to co-ordinate the
        program with the personalized Ayurvedic meals on the daily basis. The program begins with a consultation with
        our Ayurvedic doctor to assess the personal details and requirement of the guests. Each guest will be monitored
        on daily basis and adjustments to treatments will be provided if required. </p>

                                        <p>Our health is a continuum process rather than a static phenomenon being
                                            affected by both internal (Prakriti, Agni, Kostha, Oja, Sara and many
                                            others) and external (Diet, Behavior, Season, Environment and pollution,
                                            Work burden and stress and many more) factors. Our body-mind physiology is
                                            in constant interaction with these factors producing different biochemical
                                            events that in turn affect our health. During the whole process our
                                            body-mind has to function, repair, rejuvenate and eliminate bio-toxins to
                                            maintain harmony and health. Our subtle bio-intelligence is maintaining
                                            these whole processes every time but in times is overshadowed and as a
                                            result we may loss the functional rhythm of life on micro-level. If the
                                            aberration of rhythm is ignored, it may produce the subtle or gross
                                            syndrome. Panchakarma can be applied in all of these situations, from
                                            maintaining the bio-rhythm to correcting the bio-rhythmic aberration. Thus
                                            the Panchakarma can be used to maintain and rejuvenate the health and to
                                            prevent and cure the disease.</p>
                                        <p>The uniquely powerful and dynamic Panchakarma program requires in residence
                                            stay at our Health Home to co-ordinate the program with the personalized
                                            Ayurveda meals on the daily basis. The program begins with a consultation
                                            with our Ayurveda doctor to assess the personal details and requirement of
                                            the guests. Each guest will be monitored on a daily basis and adjustments to
                                            treatments will be provided if required. The Full Program is the ideal to go
                                            deeply into each of the five areas of purification (the ‘karmas’) and the
                                            time allows more treatments and provides the cumulative benefits.</p>
                                        <p>However the Ayurveda Physician may recommend the shorter treatment schedules
                                            for reasons specific to the individual. Even in such cases, the treatment
                                            schedules are complete and holistic in relation to the time availability of
                                            our guest. Whatever the length of your treatment schedule, there will be
                                            certain features in common. Although the shorter treatment schedules do not
                                            allow for all the 5 main ‘karmas’ or purification procedures of Panchakarma
                                            due to time constraints, still we can achieve a tremendous benefit. These

                                        <p>Our health is a continuum process rather than a static phenomenon. It is
                                            affected by both the internal (Prakriti, Agni, Kostha, Oja, Sara and many
                                            others) and external (Diet, Behavior, Season, Environment and pollution,
                                            Work burden and stress and many more) factors. Our body-mind physiology is
                                            in constant interaction with these factors producing different biochemical
                                            events that in turn affect our health. During the whole process our
                                            body-mind has to function, repair, rejuvenate and eliminate bio-toxins to
                                            maintain harmony and health. Our subtle bio-intelligence is maintaining
                                            these whole processes every time but in times is overshadowed and as a
                                            result we may loss the functional rhythm of life on micro-level. If the
                                            aberration of rhythm is ignored, it may produce the subtle or gross
                                            syndrome. Panchakarma can be applied in all of these situations, from
                                            maintaining the bio-rhythm to correcting the bio-rhythmic aberration. Thus
                                            the Panchakarma can be used to maintain and rejuvenate the health and to
                                            prevent and cure the disease. </p>
                                        <p>For those who cannot afford the time for Classical Full Panchakarma Program,

                                        <p>Our health is a continuum process rather than a static phenomenon. It is
                                            affected by both the internal (Prakriti, Agni, Kostha, Oja, Sara and many
                                            others) and external (Diet, Behavior, Season, Environment and pollution,
                                            Work burden and stress and many more) factors. Our body-mind physiology is
                                            in constant interaction with these factors producing different biochemical
                                            events that in turn affect our health. During the whole process our
                                            body-mind has to function, repair, rejuvenate and eliminate bio-toxins to
                                            maintain harmony and health. Our subtle bio-intelligence is maintaining
                                            these whole processes every time but in times is overshadowed and as a
                                            result we may loss the functional rhythm of life on micro-level. If the
                                            aberration of rhythm is ignored, it may produce the subtle or gross
                                            syndrome. Panchakarma can be applied in all of these situations, from
                                            maintaining the bio-rhythm to correcting the bio-rhythmic aberration. Thus
                                            the Panchakarma can be used to maintain and rejuvenate the health and to
                                            prevent and cure the disease.
                                        <p>We have designed the 15 days Classical Panchakarma Program for those who
                                            cannot afford the time for Full Program. The Program, though shorter, is
                                            complete and holistic in relation to the time availability of our guest. The
                                            treatments will provide deep rest and rejuvenation to body-mind systems.
                                            Although the shorter time do not allow for all the 5 main ‘karmas’ of
                                            purification due to time constraints, still we can achieve a tremendous
                                            benefit from the schedule. The program is ideal for seasonal adaption to
                                            climate and environmental stress and people who are in transitional stages
                                            of life and for those who desire general purification and rejuvenation.</p>

                                        <p>Our health is a continuum process rather than a static phenomenon. It is
                                            affected by both the internal (Prakriti, Agni, Kostha, Oja, Sara and many
                                            others) and external (Diet, Behavior, Season, Environment and pollution,
                                            Work burden and stress and many more) factors. Our body-mind physiology is
                                            in constant interaction with these factors producing different biochemical
                                            events that in turn affect our health. During the whole process our
                                            body-mind has to function, repair, rejuvenate and eliminate bio-toxins to
                                            maintain harmony and health. Our subtle bio-intelligence is maintaining
                                            these whole processes every time but in times is overshadowed and as a
                                            result we may loss the functional rhythm of life on micro-level. If the
                                            aberration of rhythm is ignored, it may produce the subtle or gross
                                            syndrome. Panchakarma can be applied in all of these situations, from
                                            maintaining the bio-rhythm to correcting the bio-rhythmic aberration. Thus
                                            the Panchakarma can be used to maintain and rejuvenate the health and to
                                            prevent and cure the disease. </p>

                                            those who cannot afford the time for Full Panchakarma but desire general
